Changes
-------

Psylon is a Pylon v2 fork, tuned to behave like its predecessor snek-functions
and laser-focused on seamless microservice interoperability.

Unlike Pylon v3, which aims to become a full-stack framework, Psylon is and
will remain a GraphQL-based microservice framework. Security fixes and
compatible behavioural changes from Pylon v3 that improve the v2 runtime will
be backported to Psylon where appropriate.
